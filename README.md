## The Game
Players answer questions on what information they would be comfortable disclosing, and then are asked to identify IoT devices in the home. Afterwards they interact with IoT devices to decide what information to share.
At the end players are given feedback on their choices and whether they align with the answers given at the beginning.

## Development
The game was made in the Unity Engine and using C# scripting, with sprites designed for the game.
