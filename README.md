# MInf 2 Year Dissertation Project - Privacy Adventure Game

## Motivation
The project's aim was to explore people's understanding of their privacy preferences while using Internet of Things devices, and whether their actions were in line with what they imagined.

Afterwards they interact with IoT devices to decide what information to share:

At the end players are given feedback on their choices and whether they align with the answers given at the beginning.
